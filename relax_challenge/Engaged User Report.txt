From the 12,000 users of Relaxed app, 1166 users have made 3 logins within a 7 day period, classifying them as engaged users.

My analysis of these 1166 users has highlighted several factors that predict higher user engagement.

1) Invitations
Being invited by another user increases odds of becoming an engaged use by about 4%.
Being invited by another engaged user doubles the odds of being engaged. Of engaged users, 12% were inviteded by engaged users compared to 6% of unengaged users invited by engaged users. 
11.93% of users who joined through guest invites. 

2) Method of Signup
The two forms of signup with the highest rate of active users are SIGNUP_GOOGLE_AUTH users (12.42%) and guest invite users mentioned above.
Only 5.73% of personal project users are engaged. 


3) Marketing
There is a small but statistically significant increase among engaged users in opting in to the mailing list, but no statistically significant difference among user engagement for those enabled for marketing drip.
